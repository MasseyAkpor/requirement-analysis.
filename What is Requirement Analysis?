## 📖 Requirement Analysis

### 🔹 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a **critical phase** in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, studied, and defined in detail. The primary goal is to ensure that both the development team and stakeholders have a **shared understanding** of what the software system should do and how it should perform.
This stage acts as the **foundation** for the entire development process, as the quality and accuracy of requirements directly impact the design, development, testing, and overall success of the project.

### 🔹 Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

1. **Clarity and Understanding**

   * Helps in eliminating ambiguity and misunderstandings by clearly documenting stakeholder expectations.
   * Ensures all team members are aligned on what needs to be built.

2. **Scope Definition**

   * Defines the **boundaries** of the project (what is included and excluded).
   * Prevents **scope creep**—uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in project requirements.

3. **Foundation for Design & Development**

   * Provides a clear reference for architects and developers to design the system correctly.
   * Reduces the risk of rework by ensuring the right system is built from the start.

4. **Accurate Cost & Time Estimation**

   * With well-defined requirements, project managers can make realistic estimates of cost, resources, and timelines.
   * Reduces surprises during later stages of development.

5. **Quality Assurance**

   * Forms the basis for test planning and validation.
   * Ensures the final product meets user needs and delivers value.

6. **Customer Satisfaction**

   * By involving stakeholders early and validating requirements, the delivered system is more likely to meet user expectations.

### 🔹 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Gathering 🗂️**
   Collecting requirements using techniques such as:

   * Interviews with stakeholders
   * Surveys and questionnaires
   * Workshops and focus groups
   * Observation of end-users
   * Document analysis of existing systems

2. **Requirement Elicitation ✍️**
   Refining raw requirements through:

   * Brainstorming sessions
   * Prototyping to visualize solutions
   * Use of focus groups for detailed inputs

3. **Requirement Documentation 📚**

   * Writing **Requirement Specification Documents** (functional & non-functional requirements)
   * Creating **User Stories** and **Use Cases** to describe system behavior from a user’s perspective

4. **Requirement Analysis & Modeling 📊**

   * Prioritizing requirements (critical vs. optional)
   * Performing feasibility studies (technical, financial, time)
   * Building models such as **data flow diagrams (DFDs)**, **ER diagrams**, and **use case diagrams**

5. **Requirement Validation ✅**

   * Reviewing requirements with stakeholders for accuracy and completeness
   * Defining **acceptance criteria** for each requirement
   * Creating **traceability matrices** to ensure all requirements are implemented and tested

### 🔹 Functional vs Non-functional Requirements

* **Functional Requirements (What the system should do)**
  Examples: user authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

* **Non-functional Requirements (How the system should perform)**
  Examples: performance (fast response time), security (data encryption), scalability, usability, and reliability.

### 🔹 Why Requirement Analysis is Crucial

Without proper requirement analysis:

* The system may fail to meet user expectations.
* Projects risk going over budget and missing deadlines.
* Developers may build features that are not needed, while missing critical ones.

With proper requirement analysis:

* The project has a **clear roadmap**,
* Resources are used efficiently,
* And the final system is **reliable, user-friendly, and value-driven**.
