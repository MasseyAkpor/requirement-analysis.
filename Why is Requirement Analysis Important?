1. Clarity and Shared Understanding

* Requirement Analysis ensures that both stakeholders (clients, end-users) and the development team have a clear, common understanding of what the system should do.

* It eliminates ambiguity in requirements.

* Prevents miscommunication that could lead to building the wrong system.

2. Accurate Scope, Cost, and Time Estimation

* By analyzing requirements early, the project scope is well-defined, which helps in:

* Preventing scope creep (uncontrolled changes).

* Allowing project managers to make realistic cost, resource, and timeline estimates.

* Reducing the risk of delays and budget overruns.

3. Foundation for Design, Development, and Testing

* Requirement Analysis provides the blueprint for the rest of the SDLC.

* Developers use requirements to design and implement the system correctly.

* Testers create test cases and validation strategies based on requirements.

* Ensures that the final product meets stakeholder expectations and quality standards.
