ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This repository is created to document and manage the Requirement Analysis phase of our software development project. It outlines the features and functionalities of the system, both functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system should perform). The repository serves as a central reference for stakeholders and the development team, ensuring clarity, scope definition, and a shared understanding of project goals.

It includes:

Requirement gathering techniques (interviews, surveys, workshops, etc.)

Requirement elicitation and documentation (user stories, use cases, specification documents)

Requirement analysis and modeling (prioritization, feasibility studies, diagrams)

Validation processes (acceptance criteria, reviews, and traceability)

Visual aids like use case diagrams to map interactions between users and the system

The purpose of this repository is to provide a solid foundation for design, development, and testing, while ensuring quality, scalability, and usability of the final product.
